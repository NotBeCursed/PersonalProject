**How does it work?**

**Keylogger** records all information and keeps track of everything typed to track keyboard activities.. This can be used to intercept credit card information, passwords, and other sensitive information typed into the keyboard. Keystroke loggers can be installed as malware without the userâ€™s knowledge in order to steal sensitive data.
